# Next Things to do till we are done with the rubric

1. Add student(upload files), teacher(see student files and upload files), and admin(see everything). See if you can make pages only available to certain levels of access.
-Maybe the file upload can be fufilled as a pdf lesson upload. Students can view pdfs and maybe upload to an answers database, teachers can upload and edit their and see student files. Admin can do all
2. Implement the new migrations
3. Add search bar. Try multi level dropdown.
4. Add page for viewing grades and uploaded files. Add search bars to query names and maybe completed stuff.

## Notes for how to accomplish objectives

For the flashcard pages: Set up carousel by making the flashcards pop up if the slide num is a certain number, else they are hidden.

For file upload: There is a specific type of SQL input for files. Use this and then use the php query things to print out lists of assignments in a table or something.

Make it so students can add themselves to classes. Teachers and administrators can delete students from classes and add them(teachers can only edit students in their own class).
