                        LearnX, a place for students K-12 to strive and grow through their educational learning.
                        We strive to make every year count as your students grow through this program. At LearnX,
                        we take it upon ourselves to better our platform for students and for you. We teach kids
                        their 123's, all the way up to their f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 9 (The answer is
                        xâ‰ˆ0.5231),
                        from their ABC's to full essays on complex topics our world faces. For this upcoming 2024-2025
                        school year, we hope to help teachers engage with their students more than they could. We
                        also offer personalized learning sessions so students can get the most out of their learning.
                        We make our system user-friendly so you can get the most out of our site.
                        <br><br>
                        We hope you enjoy LearnX!

            <p>
            We offer revelent courses to suit the students needs. Our flashcards and small assignments will fit<br>  
            what the student would learn during the course of that year. We run our assignments through our <br>
            employees and other teachers throughout the U.S. to ensure that every student gets the correct <br>
            information they will need to learn as best as they can. With LearnX students get the best education <br>
            they can get. Our website is easy to navigate and easy for teachers to help students. Teachers can <br>
            add their own assignments and eaisily put them into the gradebook. All of our assignments, quizzes, <br>
            and tests challenge and push students as they grow. We don't have any premium account because <br>
            of our belifs that every child deserves a fair and free education. We do ask for donations which you<br> 
            can find at the bottom of the screen.
