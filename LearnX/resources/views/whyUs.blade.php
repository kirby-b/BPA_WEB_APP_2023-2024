            <p>
            We offer revelent courses to suit the students needs. Our flashcards and small assignments will fit<br>  
            what the student would learn during the course of that year. We run our assignments through our <br>
            employees and other teachers throughout the U.S. to ensure that every student gets the correct <br>
            information they will need to learn as best as they can. With LearnX students get the best education <br>
            they can get. Our website is easy to navigate and easy for teachers to help students. Teachers can <br>
            add their own assignments and eaisily put them into the gradebook. All of our assignments, quizzes, <br>
            and tests challenge and push students as they grow. We don't have any premium account because <br>
            of our belifs that every child deserves a fair and free education. We do ask for donations which you<br> 
            can find at the bottom of the screen.
