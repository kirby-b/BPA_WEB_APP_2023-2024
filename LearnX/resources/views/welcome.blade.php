                        LearnX, a place for students K-12 to strive and grow through their educational learning.
                        We strive to make every year count as your students grow through this program. At LearnX,
                        we take it upon ourselves to better our platform for students and for you. We teach kids
                        their 123's, all the way up to their f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 9 (The answer is
                        xâ‰ˆ0.5231), from their ABC's to full essays on complex topics our world faces. For this 
                        upcoming 2024-2025 school year, we hope to help teachers engage with their students more 
                        than they could. We also offer personalized learning sessions so students can get the most 
                        out of their learning. We make our system user-friendly so you can get the most out of our site.
                        <br><br>

                        We offer revelent courses to suit the students needs. Our flashcards and small assignments will fit
                        what the student would learn during the course of that year. We run our assignments through our
                        employees and other teachers throughout the U.S. to ensure that every student gets the correct
                        information they will need to learn as best as they can. With LearnX students get the best education
                        they can get. Our website is easy to navigate and easy for teachers to help students. Teachers can

                        and tests challenge and push students as they grow. We don't have any premium account because
                        of our belifs that every child deserves a fair and free education. We do ask for donations which you

                            <p class="text-green-400">What is better about LearnX?</p>
                            <p class="text-violet-500">LearnX is a simple-to-use online website for K-12 to learn and grow. We offer class assignments and 
                            tailor to the students so we can best help their learning needs. We make learning fun by using a belt
                            system and as students go up grade levels, their belt colors will upgrade.</p>

                            <p class="text-green-400">What is the belt system?</p>
                            <p class="text-violet-500">The belt system gives a fun way for K-12 students to learn by color coding each grade. The color will become
                            more prominent as they get father into the grade.</p>
