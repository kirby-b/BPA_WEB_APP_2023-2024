                        <span class="underline">Physical Geology:</span> This branch examines the Earth's materials, including minerals and rocks, and studies the processes that form and modify the Earth's surface, such as plate tectonics, erosion, and deposition.<br>

                        <span class="underline">Mineralogy:</span> Mineralogy focuses on the study of mineralsâ€”their properties, compositions, structures, and occurrences in nature. Minerals are the building blocks of rocks and play a crucial role in understanding Earth's processes.<br>

                        <span class="underline">Petrology:</span> Petrology studies the origin, composition, and classification of rocks. It delves into how rocks form, the conditions under which they are created, and the processes that transform them over time.<br>

                        <span class="underline">Structural Geology:</span> This field examines the deformation of rocks and the forces that cause them. It involves studying folds, faults, and other structural features to understand the Earth's crustal movements.<br>

                        <span class="underline">Geomorphology:</span> Geomorphologists study the landforms and the processes that shape the Earth's surface, including erosion, weathering, rivers, glaciers, and tectonic activity.<br>

                        <span class="underline">Paleontology:</span> Paleontology is the study of ancient life forms through fossils. It helps in understanding the history of life on Earth and how life has evolved over millions of years.<br>

                        <span class="underline">Sedimentology and Stratigraphy:</span> These disciplines deal with the study of sedimentary rocks, their formation, the processes involved in their deposition, and the interpretation of rock layers (strata) to understand Earth's history.<br>

                        <span class="underline">Geological Time Scale:</span> Geologists use various dating techniques to establish the geological time scale, which helps in understanding the sequence of events and the relative ages of rocks and geological formations.<br>
