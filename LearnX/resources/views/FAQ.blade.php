                        their 123's, all the way up to their f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 9 (The answer is
                        xâ‰ˆ0.5231),
                        from their ABC's to full essays on complex topics our world faces. For this upcoming 2024-2025
                        school year, we hope to help teachers engage with their students more than they could. We
                        also offer personalized learning sessions so students can get the most out of their learning.

    <h4>What is better about LearnX?</h4>
    <p>LearnX is a simple-to-use online website for K-12 to learn and grow. We offer class assignments and 
    tailor to the students so we can best help their learning needs. We make learning fun by using a belt
    system and as students go up grade levels, their belt colors will upgrade.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>How secure will my child's and the school's information be kept?</h4>
    <p>We encrypt all information we hold so students information can be kept safe and they can learn with no worry.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the belt system?</h4>
    <p>The belt system gives a fun way for K-12 students to learn by color coding each grade. The color will become
    more prominent as they get father into the grade.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What will my kid be learning?</h4>
    <p>Any assignments on our site are the bare minimum for that grade level. Teachers are still responsible for most assignments. We
