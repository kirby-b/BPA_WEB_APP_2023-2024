                            <p class="text-violet-500">LearnX is a simple-to-use online website for K-12 to learn and grow. We offer class assignments and 
                            tailor to the students so we can best help their learning needs. We make learning fun by using a belt
                            system and as students go up grade levels, their belt colors will upgrade.</p>

                            <p class="text-green-400">How secure will my child's and the school's information be kept?</p>
                            <p class="text-violet-500">We encrypt all information we hold so students information can be kept safe and they can learn with no worry.</p>

                            <p class="text-green-400">What is the belt system?</p>
                            <p class="text-violet-500">The belt system gives a fun way for K-12 students to learn by color coding each grade. The color will become
                            more prominent as they get father into the grade.</p>

                            <p class="text-violet-500">Any assignments on our site are the bare minimum for that grade level. Teachers are still responsible for most assignments. We
                            help teach concepts but do not provide assignments for anything extra the teacher might want to add.</p>
