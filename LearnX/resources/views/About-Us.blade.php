                            I am the founder of LearnX. I helped build this website from the ground up with the goal of 
                            bringing good education to all. I have always wanted to lead something important and helpful for the world, 
                            and here at LearnX I finally have the chance. I am a programming hobbyist and hope to be one of the leading 
                            supports for any teacher who wishes to bring programming to the classroom. By working at LearnX I understand 
                            the importance of working hard and working towards your goals as a student.

                            Honesty: Here at LearnX we hold honesty very closely. As an online school platform, we understand how people can be 
                            skeptical of us and how well students may work compared to traditional school settings. But we assure you we will 
                            be transparent and help to make sure your child works just as hard on our platform as in a normal school. 
                            <br>
                            Responsiblity: At LearnX we care a lot about responsibility. The most successful people must be very responsible to 
                            get as far as they do, and just as much so to stay there. We make sure any student who uses our platform has the 
                            ability to learn how to be responsible and work their way to the top.
                            <br>
                            Equality: At LearnX we treat all of our students with equality. We make sure that all students have access to the 
                            same information, our donations go to help them, and all students learn the same information regardless of race, 
                            sex, wealth etc.
                            <br>
                            Teamwork: We organize ourselves to collaborate and manage LearnX efficiently with teamwork. We consider LearnX to
                            be a team building project and work to make the site and ourselves better. We are always providing feedback to 
                            our employees and helping them thrive in our organization. We understand that working with each other and you 
                            helps students to grow which is why teamwork is so important to us.

                            Courage: The spark that ignites the flame of curiosity in young minds is courage. It serves as the gateway to 
                            exploration, empowering children to venture into the realms of knowledge with confidence. By fostering courage,
                            we teach resilience, ensuring that every challenge becomes an opportunity for growth and discovery.

                            a sense of ownership in learning, encouraging children to chart their own course toward a future enriched with 
                            knowledge and creativity.
